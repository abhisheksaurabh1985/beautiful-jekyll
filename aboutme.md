My name is Abhishek Saurabh. I'm a Machine Learning enthusiast completely in awe of technology. I will write blogs on machine learning and software engineering and share with you all through this forum.    
</p>

For a long time I had been thinking of creating my own Github page and finally __[this](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)__ template powered by <b>Jekyll</b> helped me have one. It's literally a 3 step process as the repo owner claims :-) That said, I still new to Github pages. There could be a few UI bugs which I will resolve as and when I get some time.

The purpose of creating this website is twofold. One, to share whatever I learn with everyone. <b>Knowledge sharing</b> is one thing which makes me proud to be a part of the software development community. Two, there are some wonderful blogs out there on data science (machine learning in particular) & software development. At times it becomes difficult for me to sift through the bookmarked blogs. So, I've decided to make a summary of what I read and share the link to the source page with those who visit this website.
